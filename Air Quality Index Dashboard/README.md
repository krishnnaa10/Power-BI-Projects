# Air Quality Index Dashboard

### What is Air Quality Index ?

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool that helps people understand the quality of the air they are breathing. It takes complicated data about different pollutants in the air and turns it into a simple number, uses clear terms, and shows a color. The goal of the AQI is to let people know how safe or harmful the air is on any given day, so they can take steps to protect themselves if needed.

### Project Goal

The project focused on studying air quality data from different cities in India between 2017 and 2019. It looked at the data in several ways, using different tools for statistics and visualizations. The goal was to understand how air quality changed over the years and what insights could be gained from these changes.
